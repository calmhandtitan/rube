====

Rubiks cube implementation using opengl. all of the rubik's code written from scratch so might be buggy in some scenarios. Modified a opengl code for drawing cube to make the complete 3X3X3 rubik cube. 

compile with the opengl way:

> gcc rube.cpp -lglut -lGLU -lGL 

use left,right,down,up arrow keys for changing the view of cube

use a,s,d,f,g,r,t,y,u,i,o,p for various rotations of faces of cube

Some screenshots.
